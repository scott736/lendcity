## Introduction

When Canadian investors purchase property in the United States, one of the biggest hidden costs is the foreign exchange rate. Banks typically add a 2-3% markup on currency conversions, which on a $500,000 property can mean $10,000-$15,000 in unnecessary fees.

## The Problem with Bank Exchange Rates

Most investors don't realize how much they're losing on currency conversion. Here's how it works:

1. You check the mid-market rate (what you see on Google)
2. Your bank offers you a rate 2-3% worse
3. On large transactions, this adds up quickly

### Real Example

- Property Price: $500,000 USD
- Mid-market rate: 1.35 CAD/USD
- True cost: $675,000 CAD
- Bank rate (with 2.5% markup): 1.3838 CAD/USD
- Bank cost: $691,900 CAD
- **You lose: $16,900**

## The Solution: FX Specialists

Foreign exchange specialists like Wise, OFX, or dedicated FX brokers offer rates much closer to the mid-market rate—typically within 0.5%.

### Benefits of Using FX Specialists

- **Better rates**: Save 1.5-2.5% on every transaction
- **Lock in rates**: Forward contracts protect against currency fluctuations
- **Expert guidance**: Dedicated account managers understand real estate transactions
- **Fast transfers**: Most transfers complete within 1-2 business days

## How to Get Started

1. Open an account with an FX specialist (takes 10-15 minutes)
2. Get a quote before your next transaction
3. Compare to your bank's rate
4. Complete the transfer

## Conclusion

Smart currency management is an essential skill for cross-border real estate investors. By using the right tools, you can save thousands on every US property purchase.
